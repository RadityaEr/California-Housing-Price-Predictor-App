# üè° California Housing Price Predictor App

A simple yet powerful web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts the median house value in California districts based on user-provided housing details. This project combines data preprocessing and a trained regression model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) into a deployable machine learning pipeline.

## üß† Model Info

The app uses a `Pipeline` with:
- `StandardScaler` for numerical features
- `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features (`ocean_proximity`)
- A regression model such as `RandomForestRegressor` or `GradientBoostingRegressor`
